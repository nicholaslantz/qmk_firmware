# Nick's Ergodox EZ Custom Configuration

Keymap for the Ergodox EZ based on the 3l keyboard layout.

Notable changes are:
* Moving CTRL and ALT to the thumb keys.
* Changing TAB to go to the symbal layer when held
* Modifying the mouse/media layer to use thumb keys for pressing mouse
  buttons 1 and 2.
* Making the SUPER key hard to press as stumpwm doesn't rely on it as
  much as other tiling window managers.
  
Todo list:
* Add a qwerty base layer to make playing games easier
* Add additional media keys like volume, brightness, lock, etc.
